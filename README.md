## Description
This repository contains an application that utilizes sql, handlebars, and node js to allow a user to store their favorite burgers to be on a “consume list” as well as checking these burgers off once they’ve been consumed.


## Development
To begin, an MVC was developed with empty files accounting for the backend sql configuration, orm, controller, and server. Handlebars files were also created to serve as the viewable front end end files.  After the code for the necessary connections, methods and functions were established the front end javascript files were created that fetched the mechanisms from the back end.


## Instillation
After cloning the repository to a desired location, the user will navigate to the repositories root and type npm i to access the necessary node modules.


## Usage
Use the app here with heroku at https://pacific-caverns-78157.herokuapp.com/

-or-

To use this file simply the user will type node server.js after navigating to the repositories root and traveling to http://localhost:8000. They will then type the burger they would like to eventually eat in the input bar which will then populate on the left side of the screen waiting to be devoured. The burgers to be devoured have a devour button so that when clicked, will appear on the right side of the screen of already devoured burgers. These burgers have the option to be deleted as well.


## Tests
No tests were conducted in this application's development.
